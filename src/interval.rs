/// The `Interval` struct represents a range of values with a lower bound (`lb`) and an upper bound
/// (`ub`).
///
/// Properties:
///
/// * `lb`: The `lb` property represents the lower bound of the interval. It is of type `T`, which is a
///         generic type that must implement the `PartialOrd` trait. This means that the type `T` must be able
///         to be compared for ordering.
/// * `ub`: The `ub` property represents the upper bound of the interval. It is of type `T`, which is a
///         generic type that must implement the `PartialOrd` trait. The `PartialOrd` trait allows for
///         comparison between values of type `T`.
/// * `_marker`: The `_marker` field is a marker field that is used to indicate that the generic type
///         `T` is used in the struct. It is typically used when you want to associate a type parameter with a
///         struct, but you don't actually need to store any values of that type in the struct.
